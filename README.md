# Small Projects
The small things, hopefully with some measure of variety. Some were more useful than others.
<br></br>

## ArgsParser
There's some odd Windows API that results in command line arguments being passed as a single long string, not an array of strings. This project seeks to ammend that.

## addCSSLink
Thingy to add a css resource line to the top of a bunch of html pages.

## ascii2txt
Converts a string of ascii '0's and '1's to something more readable.

## beep
Tiny program that does nothing other than beep once. Kinda pathetic.

## curly
A thingy to download webpages or parts of webpages.

## JavaPrinting
Simple application to print all the files in a directory.

## scripts
Some general scripts.

## which
My greatly inferior windows imitation of the standard linux command 'which'.
